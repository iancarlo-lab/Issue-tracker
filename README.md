##### User Stories: 

- Prevent cross site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- I can `POST /api/issues/{projectname}` with form data containing **required issue_title, issue_text, created_by,** and optional assigned_to and status_text.

- The object saved (and returned) will include all of those fields (blank for optional no input) and also include created_on(date/time), updated_on(date/time), open(boolean, true for open, false for closed), and _id.

- I can `PUT /api/issues/{projectname}` with a id and any fields in the object with a value to object said object. Returned will be 'successfully updated' or 'could not update '+id. This should always update updated_on. If no fields are sent return 'no updated field sent'.

- I can `DELETE /api/issues/{projectname}` with a id to completely delete an issue. If no _id is sent return 'id error', success: 'deleted '+id, failed: 'could not delete '+id.

- I can `GET /api/issues/{projectname}` for an array of all issues on that specific project with all the information for each issue as was returned when posted.

- I can filter my get request by also passing along any field and value in the query(ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false). I can pass along as many fields/values as I want.

- All 11 functional tests are complete and passing.
